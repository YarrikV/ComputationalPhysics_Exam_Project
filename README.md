# Morse_Potential

## Part 1: Bound states of the Morse potential in 1D
BOUND 1:
- [x] Define trial function.
- [x] Test the increase in basis set size increases accuracy.
- [x] Compare (energy) results with other results **literature**. 

BOUND 2:
- [x] Which numerical method?
- [x] Heisenberg principle for the Morse potential.
- [x] In line with expectation?
- [x] Compare with HO results.

## Part 2: Scattering states of the Morse potential in 3D

SCAT 1:
- [x] Compute energy dependence of total cross section.
- [x] Are the results in line with your expactations?

SCAT 2:
- [x] Generate resonances.
- [x] Look at the rapid variation of the phase shift and the wave functions as one approaches the resonant energies.
- [x] With figures of the resonances, illustrate the physical principles that are conveyed in the corresponding figures of the paper.

SCAT 3:
- [ ] Compare difference of time evolution of the **resonant** and **non-resonant** parts of a wave packet.
